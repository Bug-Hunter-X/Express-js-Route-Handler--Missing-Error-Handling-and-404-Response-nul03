# Express.js Route Handler Bug: Missing Error Handling and 404 Response

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid input and the absence of a standard 404 response. The bug showcases a scenario where a route attempts to access user data based on an ID, but doesn't handle cases where the ID is invalid or the user is not found.

## Bug Description

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that fetches user data using an ID passed as a route parameter.  The code lacks crucial error handling. If the provided ID is not a number or if a user with the given ID doesn't exist, the application's behavior is undefined and may result in unexpected outputs or crashes.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler. This improved version includes:

1.  **Input validation:** It checks if the user ID is a number. If not, it sends a 400 (Bad Request) response.
2.  **404 response:** If a user with the specified ID is not found, it sends a 404 (Not Found) response.
3.  **Error handling:** Uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during data processing. (Although in this specific example the error is fairly benign)

This improved handling ensures that the application responds gracefully to invalid input and missing resources, providing informative error messages to the client.
